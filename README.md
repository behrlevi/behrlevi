## What I Do
I build, secure, and operate **cloud-native infrastructure platforms** with a strong focus on:
- Kubernetes platform engineering
- GitOps automation pipelines
- Linux systems engineering
- Network security & observability
- Secure CI/CD architecture
My engineering philosophy is built around:
**Automation · Immutability · Zero Trust · Observability · Reproducibility**

## Flagship Projects
### Enterprise-grade security homelab with Talos Linux and FluxCD
> Production-style Kubernetes platform built for learning, security experimentation, and automation design.
- Kubernetes multi-node cluster
- GitOps CI/CD pipelines
- Infrastructure automation
- Security hardening experiments
- Network segmentation & policy enforcement
**Why this matters:**
This project demonstrates **real operational ownership**, not tutorial following.
It is designed to simulate **production constraints, failure scenarios, and security trade-offs**.

> End-to-end GitOps pipeline for automated infrastructure and application delivery.
- Declarative deployments
- Git-driven promotion flows
- Secure pipeline design
- Reproducible environments

## Engineering Philosophy
I design infrastructure using the following principles:
- **GitOps over manual configuration**
- **Immutable systems over mutable servers**
- **Security as architecture, not tooling**
- **Observability before optimisation**
- **Reproducibility over local fixes**
My long-term focus is **Platform Security Engineering**.
